# Backend test

Welcome to Docplanner Group technical test

### Instructions

- **Please take some time to read the whole readme page.**
- This exercise is meant to be done in pair / mob programming with the candidate, discussing and coding the solution step by step. Discussions, proposed solutions, and proper implementation strategy will be taken into account.
- Take some time as well to get acquainted with the code before proceeding with any modification.
- This code is imperfect on purpose, you have full freedom in modifying anything in the solution and creating new files, folders and projects as well. We recommend to keep the in memory database with the current setup so you don't have to deal with setting up another database provider.

### Context

Welcome to Docplanner automated hospital. Ironically, by trying to make the healthcare more human we created a hospital which 
is fully ran by robots. In this project there is a small solution we use to allow us to check for available robots when a patient comes to the hospital
with a specific condition so we can treat them.

### Goal

This section has been moved, please check [this internal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ME0p_N9PYIDI3gesQz8xahkW86gXWTOKQI1Kuz4Mtw0/edit?usp=sharing) to provide goals for the candidate.

Needless to say, we'd like to have a **better and clearer code** after you complete any modification :D
